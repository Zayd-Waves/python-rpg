****Python RPG****

How to play:

A - Physical attack, uses your attack value
S - Casts a spell, uses your magic value


***Game Modes:
EASY mode: Monsters are relatively weak.

MEDIUM mode: Monsters have higher health points, strength and magic.

HARD mode: Monsters have even higher amounts of health points, strength and magic. They also don't flee, making each
encounter a fight till the end.

***About the game:

The main aspect of the game involves fighting against monsters, not necessarily making it to the end. This is why your
health points return after each fight. However when your health points run out, you get a game over. The monsters gain 
more HP as the player progresses through the game, making them harder to beat. The monster fights are based on 
turn-based gameplay, so some skill is required. In addition, surprise 'events' occur throughout the game that requires 
the player to input something with limited time or to remember something presented earlier in the game (memory). Lastly,
invalid input is covered with prompts that either corrects the player or prompts them with a message.
